The purpose of my analysis is to persuade customers that airline travel is the safest form of transportation despite media controversial that bring traction that greatly affected the industry due to the downing of Malaysia Airline Flights 17 which follows the disappearance of its Flight 370 in recent years. This case study combines a 3 steps project that I worked on for a couple of weeks. In the study, I created bar charts, histograms to show that flying is safer than driver. Also, I performed a Pearson correlation to showcase correlation between the variables and compared them.
